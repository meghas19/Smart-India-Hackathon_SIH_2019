        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          A calabash, bottle gourd,[1] or white-flowered gourd,[2] Lagenaria siceraria, also known by many other names, including long melon, New Guinea bean and Tasmania bean,[3] is a vine grown for its fruit, which can be either harvested young to be consumed as a vegetable, or harvested mature to be dried and used as a utensil. When it is fresh, the fruit has a light green smooth skin and white flesh.

Calabash fruits have a variety of shapes: they can be huge and rounded, small and bottle shaped, or slim and serpentine, and they can grow to be over a metre long. Rounder varieties are typically called calabash gourds. The gourd was one of the world's first cultivated plants grown not primarily for food, but for use as containers. The bottle gourd may have been carried from Africa to Asia, Europe, and the Americas in the course of human migration,[4] or by seeds floating across the oceans inside the gourd. It has been proven to have existed in the New World prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus.[5]

Because bottle gourds are also called "calabashes", they are sometimes confused with the hard, hollow fruits of the unrelated calabash tree, Crescentia cujete, whose fruits are also used to make utensils, containers, and musical instruments.[6]

            Like other members of the Cucurbitaceae family, gourds contain cucurbitacins that are known to be cytotoxic at a high concentration. The tetracyclic triterpenoid cucurbitacins present in fruits and vegetables of the cucumber family are responsible for the bitter taste, and could cause stomach ulcers. In extreme cases, people have died from drinking the juice of gourds.[14][15][16] The toxic cases are usually due to the gourd being used to make juice, which the drinkers described as being unusually bitter.[17] In three of the lethal cases, the victims were all diabetics in their 50s and 60s.[17] However, in June 2018 a healthy woman in her early 40s was hospitalized for severe reactions after consuming the juice and died three days later from complications.[18]

However, the plant is not normally toxic when eaten and is safe to consume. The excessively bitter (and toxic) gourds are due to improper storage (temperature swings or high temperature) and over-ripening.[19]

To avoid poisoning, it is advised to:[17]

Taste a small piece of the gourd to make sure it is not unusually bitter, before making juice
Discard all excessively bitter gourd or juice
Do not mix the juice of gourds with other juices, such as that of bitter gourd, so as not to mask the taste if it has gone bad.
