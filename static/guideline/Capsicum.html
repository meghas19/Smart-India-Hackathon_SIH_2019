        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           India is a land of diverse agro climatic zones and each of these
zones offer a great potential for cultivation of wide range of crops across
all seasons. Vegetables form major and important part of our dietary
requirements, which are widely grown in the rural and peri-urban areas.
Hi-tech horticulture including protected cultivation of high value and exotic
vegetables has been
on the increase,
targeting high end
domestic and export
market. Of late, due
to the population
pressure, fragmentation of land
holdings and
urbanization have led to decline in cultivable area, more so in urban and
peri-urban areas. Production of vegetables under protected cultivation
system results in effective use of the land resources, besides being able
to increase the production of quality vegetables both for the export and
domestic markets by offsetting biotic and abiotic stresses to a great
extent that otherwise is prevalent in open cultivation. Under protected
cultivation, capsicums are widely grown due to higher productivity and
economic feasibility.
Capsicum, also known as sweet pepper, bell pepper or Shimla Mirch
is one of the popular vegetables grown throughout India. It is rich in
Vitamin A (8493 IU), Vitamin C (283 mg) and minerals like Calcium
(13.4 mg), Magnesium (14.9 mg) Phosphorus (28.3 mg) Potassium,
(263.7 mg) per 100 g fresh weight. Capsicum is a cool season crop, but
Protected Cultivation of Capsicum
1
it can be grown
round the year using
protected structures
where temperature
and relative
humidity (RH) can
be manipulated.
This crop requires
day temperature of
25-300
C and night temperature of 18-200
C with relative humidity of 50-
60%. If temperature exceeds 350
C or falls below 120
C, fruit setting is
affected.
Coloured capsicums are in great demand in urban markets. The
demand is mostly driven by hotel and catering industry. The traditionally
grown green capsicum, depending upon variety and season, usually yields
20-40 tons per hectare in about 4-5 months. In greenhouse, the crop
duration of green and colored capsicums is about 7 -10 months and
yields about 80-100 t per hectare. The advantages of protected cultivation
are;
 Higher productivity resulting in increased yield,
 Provides better growing environment to plants,
 Protects from rain, wind, high temperatures and minimizes the
damage of insect pests and diseases thereby improving the quality
and yield,
 Facilitates year round production coupled with yield enhancement
by 2-3 times compared to open cultivation.
Research and development of greenhouse/protected cultivation of
vegetables was initiated at IIHR, Bengaluru in the year 2000 and the
complete package for protected cultivation of capsicum was developed
by 2005. Since then many farmers and entrepreneurs have adopted the
2
protected cultivation of vegetables, especially coloured capsicum, on
commercial scale and are being benefited. Some of the points that have
to be considered for successful cultivation of the crop have been
enumerated in the following pages.
